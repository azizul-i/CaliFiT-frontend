# CaliFiT-frontend
A web app that lets you create, find, and share workouts (front-end)

Tools:  
React/TypeScript, and Semantic-UI for building a clean user interface.
npm was used to retrieve a FB style button, however I had to register the AppId against my own account details and set it up to work appropriatly.
Documentation from React/TypeScript, Semantic-UI and JavaScript were used for understanding and building my CaliFiT web app!

To run locally ensure you have the latest Node installed.

Run `npm i` in cali-fit directory
Run  `npm start`


To use the deployed web app visit: https://califit.azurewebsites.net/
